## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario where **Space Y**, a new rocket company, seeks to compete with **SpaceX**. By analyzing public data from SpaceX's launches, we build predictive models to determine whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land and be reused, which plays a major role in reducing the cost of launches.

---

## Motivation
Reusability is key in reducing costs for space missions. Understanding when and why the **Falcon 9 first stage** successfully lands helps improve decision-making and optimize pricing for future launches. This project applies machine learning techniques to make such predictions.

---

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from public SpaceX launch data and includes:
- **Launch Dates**
- **Payload Information**
- **Orbital Parameters**
- **Launch Outcome**
- **First Stage Landing Outcome**

---

## Technologies Used
This project leverages the following tools and technologies:
- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation and model development.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation library.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and analysis.

  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Model Training</summary>

  - **Logistic Regression** for initial classification.
  - **Decision Trees** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to improve accuracy.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for robust classification.
  
</details>

---

## Results
The results from the models showed:
- **Logistic Regression** achieved an accuracy of X%.
- **KNN** and **Decision Trees** had Y% accuracy, with notable performance on certain classes.
- **SVM** was able to achieve Z% accuracy, providing more insight into complex data patterns.

---

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Explore additional features to improve the prediction models.
- Deploy the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI** for real-time predictions.
